### Rubik's Cube

## Tech stack
- React
- Typescript
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Jest
- React Testing Library

## Overview
A responsive rubik's cube game. Rotate the planes of the cube until the rubik's cube is solved! This is my solution to a technical test. Given more time, it would look a lot different! The technical test did not require a UI representation but I've made a basic one.

## Features
- UI representation of the game that is responsive to the window size.
- Ability to rotate any face clockwise or anti-clockwise.
- Buttons to control the rotations.

## Future work (given more time)
- I would like to use a state management tool such as Redux. It would have reduced the usage of props and would have made it more easily testable.
- More tests. I have only written one test which is to show that I know how to write them.
- Keyboard interactions.
- A nicer UI for the buttons. I didn't put much effort into their appearance due to time constraints.
- Animations
- Randomiser button
- Celebration when it's completed
- ...Much more
