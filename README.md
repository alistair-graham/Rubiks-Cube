# Rubik's Cube

## Tech stack
- React
- Typescript
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- Jest

## Overview
A responsive rubik's cube game. Rotate the planes of the cube until the rubik's cube is solved! This is my solution to a technical test. Given more time, it would look a lot different!

## Features
- UI representation of the game that is responsive to the window size.
- Ability to rotate any axis clockwise or anti-clockwise.
- Buttons to control the rotations.

## Future work (given more time)
- I would have liked to have used a state management tool such as Redux. It would have reduced the usage of props and would have made it more easily testable.
- Keyboard interactions
- A nicer UI for the buttons. I didn't put much effort into their appearance.

## How to run locally
- Clone the repository locally.
- Run the following commands:

&emsp;`npm install`

&emsp;`npm start`
